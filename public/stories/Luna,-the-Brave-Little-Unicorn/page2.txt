Luna loved exploring her magical home, but there was one place she had never dared to goâ€”the Enchanted Meadow. It was rumored to be guarded by an enormous, grumpy dragon named Drago. Drago had scales as black as night and eyes that glowed like the amber flames he could breathe. His wings were vast, casting a shadow that blanketed the meadow when he flew. His claws were as sharp as the tallest pine trees, and his roar could shake the very mountains.

Despite the stories, Luna was curious. One sunny morning, with the birds singing and butterflies dancing around her, Luna decided it was time to face her fears and visit the Enchanted Meadow. She trotted with determination through the forest, her heart pounding with both excitement and nervousness.
