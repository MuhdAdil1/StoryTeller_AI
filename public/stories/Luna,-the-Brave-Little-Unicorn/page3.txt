As she approached the meadow's edge, Luna saw a stunning sight—a field of the most beautiful flowers she had ever seen, petals hues ranging from deep purples to vibrant yellows. The meadow was an endless sea of color under the golden sunlight. Luna stepped into this paradise, her worries starting to fade as the scents of the blooms filled her with courage.

Suddenly, a shadow loomed over her, and Luna looked up to see Drago staring at her. Despite his fearsome appearance, Luna noticed something strange in Drago’s eyes—loneliness. “Who dares to enter my meadow?” Drago roared. Trembling but determined, Luna replied, “I am Luna, and I am not afraid.”

Drago was taken aback by her bravery and admitted he was lonely guarding the meadow alone. Luna's courage and kind heart soon helped them become the best of friends. And from that day on, the Enchanted Meadow was open to everyone, guarded by the most unlikely pair—Luna the Brave and Drago the Gentle.
