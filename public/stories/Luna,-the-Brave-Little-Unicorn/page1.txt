In a lush, magical forest filled with towering, ancient trees and sparkling streams, lived a small unicorn named Luna. She had silky, white fur that shimmered under the sunlight and a dazzling silver horn spiraling from her forehead. Her mane and tail were a flowing rainbow of colors, making her impossible to miss when she pranced through the glades. Luna's eyes were big, bright, and the color of a clear, blue sky.

The forest itself was a place of wonder. Enormous oak trees with leaves that glittered like emeralds provided a canopy, while the forest floor was covered in a soft, mossy carpet, adorned with tiny flowers of every shade. The streams flowed crystal-clear, reflecting specks of sunlight like a million tiny diamonds.
