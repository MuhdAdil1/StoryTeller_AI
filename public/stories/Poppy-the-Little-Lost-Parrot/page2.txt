Before she knew it, Poppy found herself in a dense, unfamiliar jungle. Tall trees towered above her, their branches heavy with exotic fruits and blossoms of every color. The sunlight barely peeked through the thick canopy, casting magical shadows on the forest floor. Birds with glistening feathers and strange animals with bright patterns roamed freely. Poppy realized she was lost in this wild, unknown place.

As the day turned to dusk, Poppy's panic grew. But then, she heard a gentle voice calling her name. It was Kiwi, an old, wise parrot from her village, with gray feathers and kind eyes that have seen many adventures. Kiwiâ€™s feathers were dusty but still shone with a silver sheen under the moonlight. He calmly guided Poppy back through the jungle, where the trees whispered stories of old, and the path seemed to glow under the starlit sky. Finally, they reached the comfort of their village, and Poppy vowed to always be more careful on her adventures.
