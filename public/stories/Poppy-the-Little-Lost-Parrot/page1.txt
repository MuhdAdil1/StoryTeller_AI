Once upon a time in a small, colorful village, there lived a little parrot named Poppy. She had vibrant green feathers that glittered like emeralds in the sunlight. Poppyâ€™s wings were edged with a dazzling blue hue, and her beak was bright orange, curving elegantly at the tip. Poppy's tail feathers fanned out in a beautiful array of colors, looking like a rainbow against the sky. Her eyes were large and curious, sparkling with a hint of mischief and adventure.

One sunny morning, as the village was buzzing with excitement, Poppy decided to venture a bit farther than usual. She flapped her wings and soared into the air, the village getting smaller and smaller beneath her.
