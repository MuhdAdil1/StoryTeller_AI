One sunny afternoon, Olly saw a bunch of carrots looking a bit down. They were crisp and orange, with bushy green tops, their bright color contrasting against the rich, dark soil. Olly wanted to cheer them up. He approached them with his usual friendly bounce and said, "Hello, my carrot friends! Why so glum?"

The carrots smiled at first, but soon tears began to roll down their cheeks. Olly was confused and sad. He didn't understand why his friends always started crying around him. Determined to find out, Olly set off to visit the wise old cabbage at the far end of the garden. The cabbage had deep green leaves that curled around to form a tight head, his surface dappled with a pattern that looked like nature’s own fingerprint.

Olly explained his problem, and the wise cabbage looked at him with gentle understanding. "Oh, dear Olly," he said in a raspy, soothing voice. "You are a wonderful friend, but you have a unique essence that makes others tear up. It’s not your fault; it’s just how onions are."

Hearing this, Olly felt a mix of relief and sadness. He realized that his essence was just part of who he was, and even though it made others cry, it didn't mean they weren't happy to see him. From that day on, Olly continued to be his cheerful self, making sure to keep a little distance when chatting with his friends. That way, they could enjoy his company without the tears.

And so, Olly lived happily in the garden, loved and accepted by all, tears and all.
